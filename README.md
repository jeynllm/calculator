Project Overview:
This project is calculator in Java that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as multiplication, division, subtraction, addition, modulus, exponentiation, square root, absolute value, and rounding. The program is menu-driven, taking user input through the console and displaying results for each operation.

Document the algorithms and data structures used:
I used basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %).
Math.pow() and Math.sqrt() are used for exponentiation and square roots.
Simple error handling for invalid operations, division by zero, and negative square roots.

Mention any improvements made to the initial implementation:
Error handling for edge cases like division by zero and negative square roots also output formatting for division to display three decimal places.The program could be extended to include more advanced operations like logarithms, trigonometric functions (e.g., sine, cosine), and matrix operations.

Indicate whether files were used for input or output, and explain their role:
Using the Scanner class to gather input, and displays results directly in the console.
Role of Input/Output:
Input: The program takes user input via the console (standard input) where the user enters numbers and selects operations.
Output: The results of the calculations are printed directly to the console (standard output).

Provide any additional explanations or details that may help the reader understand your approach:
The calculator is designed in a way that it can easily be extended to include more advanced mathematical functions like logarithms, trigonometric functions, or even matrix operations in the future.For division results, the program uses String.format() to format the output to three decimal places. This provides a more polished user experience, especially when dealing with floating-point arithmetic where precision is important.

Conclusion:
This simple Java calculator is a well-structured, functional program for performing basic to moderately advanced mathematical calculations.
